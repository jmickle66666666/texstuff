texstuff.py has stuff in it 


if you run build_fake_texture_set(), or run it in CLI with format:
texstuff.py wad1.wad wad2.wad

then it will build a wad of textures from wad 1, with the names of the closest matching textures from wad2.

this is fun for retexturing a map from one texture set to another. probably not much other use
